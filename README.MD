# Introduction
A small Python Flask server that runs an instance of Ardupilot SITL for interaction from https://github.com/rhysbartholomaeus/leafletQt_QML.

Yes the code is bad.

The intention is to demonstrate live data being streamed to a webpage, whilst also being interactive. It's not intended to be a fully-fledged ground control station. Just a proof of concept.

## Pre-reqs
TODO
* Python 3.8.5 
* Ardupilot SITL

Python libs:
* Flask
* Flask CORS
* mavutil
* dronekit_sitl
* dronekit

It currently runs in a WSL Ubuntu image.

The start path for the Ardupilot process is hardcoded. To be fixed.

## FIX ME
